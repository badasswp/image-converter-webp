== Description ==

As an internet user, you already know images can be the difference between a great website experience and a terrible one! Think about how often you've landed on a website and hit the back button because the home page was too busy or the banner image was taking so much time to load due to its size.

You may not realize it, but imagery is a large part of it. This plugin helps take care of all those concerns, by converting your WordPress images to WebP format during page load so that your site loads extremely fast, without any disruptions or downtime.
